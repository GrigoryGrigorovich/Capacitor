# Capacitor
To calculate the capacitance of a capacitor, you need to know the area of the terminals, i.e. the surface area between which the electrodes are located. Thus, by increasing the size of the terminals, the capacitance can be increased.

Capacitance C (in farads) = ε0 * εr * A / d,

where ε0 is the electrical permeability (8.85*10^-12 F/m), εr is the dielectric constant (1-∞), A is the area of the plates (m2) and d is the distance between the plates (m).
